# NeuroDataAlchemy

Welcome to the NeuroDataAlchemy repository! This repository contains research projects focused on the analysis of brain aging, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease, by leveraging data science techniques and neuroscience methodologies.

## Projects

### 1. Data Visualization of Brain Aging
This project aims to visualize and analyze brain aging patterns using various data visualization techniques. It explores the relationships between neuroimaging data, cognitive measures, and demographic factors in the context of aging and Alzheimer's disease.

### 2. Nipype Preprocessing Pipeline
This project involves the creation of a Nipype-based preprocessing pipeline for neuroimaging data, including preprocessing steps such as motion correction, registration, and artifact removal.

### 3. DTI Analysis
In this project, we explore diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data to investigate white matter alterations in brain aging and Alzheimer's disease.
